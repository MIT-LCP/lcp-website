    title: "MIMIC-IV is now available!"
    content: "We are delighted to announce that MIMIC-IV has been <a href='https://doi.org/10.13026/a3wn-hq05'>published on PhysioNet</a>. MIMIC-IV, the latest version of MIMIC, is a database comprising comprehensive clinical information on hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. Major changes from <a href='https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26'>MIMIC-III</a> include: (1) a modular structure that links core hospital data to multiple data sources, including chest x-ray images; (2) an approach to date shifting that provides approximate year of admission; (3) new sources of data; such as the electronic medicine administration record. <br /><br />The dataset is available from PhysioNet, and access is managed in the same way as MIMIC-III. If you already have access to MIMIC-III, then you will be granted access after signing the Data Use Agreement. New users will need to complete the credentialing process first (see: <a href='https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/access/'>https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/access/</a> for more details)."

    title: "Opportunity for a Postdoctoral Associate to join the PhysioNet team"
    content: "The MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology is seeking a Post-Doctoral Associate to conduct independent research in health care informatics. The Laboratory is an NIH-supported multi-disciplinary group of clinicians, data scientists and engineers that produced the publicly distributed and growing <a href='https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26'>MIMIC database</a>. It is a rich and open research resource that supports signal processing and machine learning research leading to new knowledge and patient-specific prognostic and therapeutic guidance for critical care.  The Postdoc will contribute to the design and management of the current and future MIMIC databases, and will conduct multidisciplinary original research together with clinicians. The position provides the opportunity to interact with a world-class laboratory comprised of engineers, mathematicians and clinical staff working at the frontiers of translational medicine and advanced research in the domain of critical care informatics and machine learning. <br /><br />The Research Fellow will both contribute to ongoing research projects and propose innovative new projects suitable for research grant funding. The ideal candidate has a doctoral degree in science or engineering, or a related discipline to assure high level understanding of the research environment. Experience in relational database development and administration is important, ideally in a medical environment. Competence and experience in a subset of the following is expected: Linux, Python, data management. Knowledge of medical terminology is desirable. Strong interpersonal and communication skills are essential. For more details, send a letter of interest and CV to Prof. Roger Mark at: rgmark AT mit.edu."
