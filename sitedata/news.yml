    title: "New Toolkit Added: dSQI"
    content: "The advent of telehealth applications and remote patient monitoring has led to an increasing need for continuous signal quality monitoring to ensure high diagnostic accuracy of the recordings. Cardiovascular diseases often manifest electrophysiological anomalies, therefore the electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most used signals for diagnostic applications. Various types of noise and artifacts are not uncommon in ECG recordings and assessing the quality of the signal is essential prior to any clinical interpretation. In this study, a dynamic signal quality index (dSQI) is introduced using a new time-frequency template-based approach."

    title: "New Database Added: RVMH1"
    content: "Functional metrics of autonomic control of heart rate, including baroreflex sensitivity, have been shown to be strongly associated with cardiovascular risk. A decrease in baroreflex sensitivity with aging is hypothesized to represent a contributing causal factor in the etiology of primary hypertension. To assess baroreflex function in human subjects, two complementary methods to simulate the response in heart rate elicited by the Valsalva maneuver were developed and applied to data obtained from a cohort of healthy normal volunteers."
