                His research interest is in data mining and the application of machine learning on large databases.
                He works with MIMIC, the publicly-available de-identified ICU database from BIDMC.
                He is working on a data-driven decision support system known as Collective Experience that (1) allows a clinician to draw on the experience of other clinicians who have taken care of similar patients as recorded in a clinical database, and (2) uses models performed on relatively homogeneous patient subsets.

                Alistair joined the Laboratory for Computational Physiology in 2015 and is currently a full time Research Scientist.
                He received his B.Eng in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University, Canada, and subsequently read for a D.Phil in Healthcare Innovation at the University of Oxford.
                His thesis was titled "Mortality and acuity assessment in critical care", and its focus included using machine learning techniques to predict mortality and develop new severity of illness scores for patients admitted to intensive care units.
                Before joining the LCP, Alistair spent a year as a research assistant at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he worked on building early alerting models for patients post-ICU discharge.
                He has extensive experience and expertise in working with ICU data, and in building decision support tools for critically ill patients.
                He is actively engaged in research investigations with clinical colleagues.
                He has worked extensively on creating and releasing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and eICU databases, and in actively supporting its user community.

                Mr. Benjamin Moody is a scientific programmer with extensive experience in physiologic signal processing.
                He manages the acquisition, reformatting, de-identification and archiving of the physiologic waveform data that accumulates continuously at a rate of 400 GB (3,000 waveform records) per month!
                The data is collected from all patients in the ICUs and NICUs at BIDMC by the Philips monitors.
                The waveforms are archived by the Philips Data Warehouse Connect system, and are transmitted to MIT via a VPN network connection.
                Mr. Moody extracts the data, reformats it into wfdb flat files, de-identifies and time-shifts it, and ultimately matches it to associated clinical data.
